#Functions in Python
#great way not to repeat some thing that you have alredy done
# to create function we use the def keyword
#writing functions are as easy as it sounds we just need to define the function and then call it using the d

def first_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
print(first_function())
def addition(a,b):
    return a+b
print(addition(1,2))

# ive annotated my additin function to make to more self documented i can even have an inter[reted type 

#scope of a function

#Local

#global
#built in
